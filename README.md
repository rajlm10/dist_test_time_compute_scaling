# Search and Learn

Recipes to enhance LLM capabilities by scaling inference-time compute. Name inspired by Rich Sutton's [Bitter Lesson](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf):

> One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are _**search**_ and _**learning**_.

## What is this?

Over the last few years, the scaling of _**train-time compute**_ has dominated the progress of LLMs. Although this paradigm has proven to be remarkably effective, the resources needed to pretrain ever larger models are becoming prohibitively expensive, with billion-dollar clusters already on the horizon. This trend has sparked significant interest in a complementary approach: _**test-time compute scaling.**_ Rather than relying on ever-larger pretraining budgets, test-time methods use dynamic inference strategies that allow models to ‚Äúthink longer‚Äù on harder problems. A prominent example is OpenAI‚Äôs o1 model, which shows consistent improvement on difficult math and coding problems as one increases the amount of test-time compute.

Although we don't know how o1 was trained, Search and Learn aims to fill that gap by providing the community with a series of recipes that enable open models to solve complex problems if you give them enough ‚Äútime to think‚Äù. 

## News üóûÔ∏è

* **December 16, 2024**: Initial release with code to replicate the test-time compute scaling results of our [blog post](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute).

## How to navigate this project üß≠

This project is simple by design and mostly consists of:

* [`scripts`](./scripts/) to scale test-time compute for open models. 
* [`recipes`](./recipes/) to apply different search algorithms at test-time. Three algorithms are currently supported: Best-of-N, beam search, and Diverse Verifier Tree Search (DVTS). Each recipe takes the form of a YAML file which contains all the parameters associated with a single inference run. 

To get started, we recommend the following:

1. Follow the [installation instructions](#installation-instructions) to set up your environment etc.
2. Replicate our test-time compute results by following the [recipe instructions](./recipes/README.md).

## Contents

The initial release of Search and Learn will focus on the following techniques:

* **Search against verifiers:** guide LLMs to search for solutions to "verifiable problems" (math, code) by using a stepwise or process reward model to score each step. Includes techniques like Best-of-N sampling and tree search.
* **Training process reward models (coming soon!):** train reward models to provide a sequence of scores, one for each step of the reasoning process. This ability to provide fine-grained feedback makes PRMs a natural fit for search methods with LLMs.


# Installation instructions

To run the code in this project, first, create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:

```shell
conda create -n sal python=3.11 && conda activate sal
```

```shell
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Next, log into your Hugging Face account as follows:

```shell
huggingface-cli login
```

Finally, install Git LFS so that you can push models to the Hugging Face Hub:

```shell
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

You can now check out the `scripts` and `recipes` directories for instructions on how to scale test-time compute for open models!
