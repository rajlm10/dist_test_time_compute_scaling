However, since $r$ must be positive, this tells us something about the point's location in the plane.\n\n## Step 3: For the $y$-coordinate, we have $3 = r\\sin\\theta$. Since $r = 0$ from the $x$-coordinate, we can't directly solve for $\\theta$.\nHowever, we can note that when $r = 0$, $\\sin\\theta = 0$, which means $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$ (or in general, $\\theta = k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer).\n\n## Step 4: We need to apply the correct quadrant for the point (0,3), and find theta.\nThe point (0,3) lies in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. In polar coordinates, the angle $\\theta$ is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\n## Step 5: Now let's correctly calculate the angle $\\theta$ given $r=0$. Since $r$ cannot be zero, this clearly indicates that the point lies on the positive x-axis, which corresponds to a specific angle in the range $0\\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$. The point (0,3) will be $(0,3)$ in the coordinate system, hence the polar coordinate is (0,3).\n\n## Step 6: Therefore, the polar coordinate of point (0,3) is (0,3).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(0,3)}$","## Step 1: Recall the conversion formulas\nTo convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8), we use the following formulas: $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ for the radial coordinate, and $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$ for the angular coordinate.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the radial coordinate (r)\nGiven the point (0, 3), we can calculate the radial coordinate (r) using the formula: $r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the angular coordinate (\u03b8)\nNow that we have the radial coordinate (r), we can calculate the angular coordinate (\u03b8) using the formula: $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$. However, since x = 0, the point lies on the y-axis. In polar coordinates, when the point is on the y-axis, the angle is usually 0 or \u03c0. Since y is positive, the angle is \u03c0.\n\n## Step 4: Write the polar coordinates\nCombining the results from steps 2 and 3, we can write the polar coordinates as $(r, \\theta) = (3, \\pi)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, \\pi)}$","## Step 1: Recall the conversion formulas\nThe conversion formulas from rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ are $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ for the radial coordinate and $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$ for the angular coordinate.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the conversion formulas\nGiven the point $(0,3)$, we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=3$ into the formulas to find the radial and angular coordinates.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the radial coordinate\n$r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the angular coordinate\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{0}\\right)$.
